Setting up VS Code for terraform
We need to install an extension for Terraform from hashicorp

Creating the required infra with Terraform
Activity 1: I want to create a vpc with 4 subnets in AWS
AWS Credentials
Ensure you have aws cli installed and configured (view classroom recording to create one)
Data types in Terraform
official docs
string: this will be in quotes
number
bool
list
set
map or object
Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL)
Refer Here for official docs
Terraform AWS Provider
official docs
Terraform block to choose the provider and version
terraform {
    required_providers {
        aws = {
            source = "hashicorp/aws"
            version = "5.82.2"
        }
    }

}

Lets try to configure the provider
provider "<name>" {
    arg1 = value1
    ...
    ..
    argn = valuen

}
AWS Provider Argument reference
As of now our main.tf looks as shown below
terraform {
    required_providers {
      aws = {
        source = "hashicorp/aws"
        version = "5.82.2"
      }
    }
}

provider "aws" {
    region = "ap-south-1"
}
Now from terminal
download providers and initialize terraform init
Preview
Format the template terraform fmt
Validate the template terraform validate
Resource block in terraform
resource "type" "identifier" {
    arg1 = value1
    ...
    ..
    argn = valuen
}
Now to find resources,
Search in provider docs
google terraform <cloud> <resource>
vpc resource docs
Add the vpc resource block so as of now the template is
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.82.2"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
}


resource "aws_vpc" "network" {
  cidr_block = "10.10.0.0/16"
  tags = {
    Name = "from tf"
  }

}
Now to create infrastructure, execute terraform apply where the plan will be shown

To be continuedâ€¦

Terraform
Variables
Variables are the inputs that can be passed
official docs
basic syntax for creating a variable
variable "<name>" {
    type = <datatypes of terrarform>
    default = ""
    description = "purpose of variable"
}
To use the variable use syntax var.<name>
Using variables in activity 1
Refer Here for the changes
Variable values can be passed during apply
terraform apply -var "<name>=<value>"
terraform apply -var vpc_cidr=10.0.0.0/16
Variables values can be stored in a file with extension .tfvars and passed during apply. Refer Here for docs
terraform apply -var-file='default.tfvars'
Outputs
Terraform template outputs show the output after every apply Refer Here for official docs
Sample output

Adding a sample output to activity 1

Activity 2: Create a Network in Azure
Overview
Preview
Manual steps: (Watch classroom recording)
Terraform azure providers
azurerm (Hashicorp) this is most widely used
azapi (Microsoft) few customers use this as well

Terraform
Terraform state file
On every apply (success) a state file representing resources created is maintained by default in the terraform.tfstate file
Preview

Accessing attributes
syntax for resource attributes
<type>.<id/name>.<attribute>
To play with this we can use terraform console
Preview
If you use attribute of resource A in resource B, the creation order will be first A then B this is referred as implcit dependency
Resource creation order can be controlled implicitly or even explicitly by using depends_on
Activity 1: I want to create a vpc with 4 subnets in AWS (contd)
Lets try adding 4 subnets
Lets start with one subnet
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.82.2"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
}


resource "aws_vpc" "network" {
  cidr_block = "10.100.0.0/16"
  tags = {
    Name = "from tf"
  }

}

resource "aws_subnet" "web1" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.network.id
  availability_zone = "ap-south-1a"
  cidr_block        = "10.100.0.0/24"
  tags = {
    Name = "web-1"
  }
  depends_on        = [aws_vpc.network]

}
Lets add three other subnets
web-2:
cidr: 10.100.1.0/24
az: ap-south-1b
db-1:
cidr: 10.100.2.0/24
az: ap-south-1a
db-2:
cidr: 10.100.3.0/24
az: ap-south-1b

Lets understand the work we have done,
This template creates a vpc with 4 subnets in mumbai region with fixed ip ranges
